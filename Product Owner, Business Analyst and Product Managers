> **The Challenge** 

Systone provides technology products and services to Medical Health groups and physician practices. One of these products is a Continuing Education (CE) Portal that allows their
clients’ network/group physicians to obtain information on Continuing Education Credit opportunities unique to their specialty.

Currently, the CE Portal supports the physician profession but not the Nurse Practitioner profession. This is a gap for both existing and prospective clients.
Systone needs to expand its CE Portal to meet the needs of its existing clients and to satisfy the requirements of prospective clients. Four of our top ten clients have
inquired/requested the ability to provide the same services to Nurse Practitioners.

Additionally, user feedback identified the need for an enhancement that allows the user to save selected courses to a Wish List to view in future sessions. 

Currently, the Portal user course wish list information is not available to the business but we would like to have access to the Portal user and their CE Course wish list data as administrators.

As a member of Systone's functional team, you need to write user stories with acceptance criteria for the development team to deliver the request.


**Mandatory Work:**

- Your task is to tap into your imagination and create an initial draft of 5-10 user stories with acceptance criteria from the task above.... to help formulate specs for engineers and developers to work with.


**FAQS:**

**Q:** What will you be grading me on?
